Name: Ukpai Ugochi

Brief Bio: I am a Female Nigerian, with a Bachelor's degree in Marine engineering and 
Bootcamp certificates in Software development. I'm a full stack JavaScript developer (MEVN) stack. 
I love to share knowledge about my transition from marine engineering to software development in form of writting, 
to encourage people who love software development and don't know where to begin. I contribute to FOSS in my free time!
